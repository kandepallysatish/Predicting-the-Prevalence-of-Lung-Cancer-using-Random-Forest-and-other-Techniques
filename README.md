Healthcare sector is one of the most important sectors of any country as a big part of the country’s econ-omy is associated with it. The research is about to contribute to the health sector by minimizing the expenses of a lung cancer diagnosis. The study tries to devise an efﬁcient method for initial screening of the patients with symptoms through their demographic and clinical data. The study seeks appropriate feature transformation techniques from dimensionality reduction techniques in combination with an apposite regression model that can perform this task robustly using the lung cancer dataset for early car-cinoma diagnosis. To equip the health sector with state-of-the-art technology and for the betterment of humankind, the most beneﬁcial tool of today is machine learning. Lungs play a vivacious role in the human body, oxygen is circulated in the body, and the air is taken from the atmosphere and sends it into the bloodstream. Several people decease every year because of lung carcinoma as lung cancer is normally identiﬁed at the latter phase due to lack of awareness. It stays unidentiﬁed because people have pneumo-nia often, which converts into lung cancer later. The projected research seeks to enable health profession-als to the rationalization of primary diagnosis and treatment of lung carcinoma in developing countries. The proposed methodology has selected the classifier-based machine learing technique for the available patterns based on demographic and clinical features of lung cancer patients. Our proposed model shows accuracy of 99.07%

we achieved near to 99.07% Accuracy on Random Forest technique
